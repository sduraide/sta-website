        <h2>What is Responsible CS?</h2>
        <p>The Responsible CS program aims to integrate ethics and social impact topics across Brown's computer science curriculum. Presenting ethical questions alongside technical information will draw a clear connection between the choices of
          computer scientists and their societal effects, and give students an opportunity to practice and analyze ethical design over the course of their entire computer science education. </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Why are ethics important?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As the role of technology increases in nearly every area of life, the work of computer scientists has a broader impact on society.</li>
          <li>Technical decisions, if widely adopted, can inadvertently function as policy decisions, and computer scientists are often given broad leeway to make those decisions.</li>
          <li>Technology can be harnessed to improve lives, but engineers and designers are often not asked to consider its adverse effects.</li>

        <h2 class="text-center">What does it mean to be ethical? </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize that technology is not neutral, nor does it exist in a vacuum; it contains built-in biases that reflect the preferences, norms, and worldview of its creators.
          </li>
          <li>Build with everyone in mind.
          </li>
          <li>Understand and fulfill the responsibility to advocate against unethical product or research decisions.

        </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The program embeds TAs in a set of selected classes with the goal of getting Brown CS students to think about the ethical considerations of their concentration from the beginning of their time in the department
          through graduation and beyond. This is accomplished by integrating modules on ethics into the fabric of each target class, encouraging students to think about ethics in a structured way, and applying these ideas in projects.</p>

        <b>How does the ETA program interact with the courses and professors?</b> <br>
        For each course that the program works with, one or more ETAs work as members of the course staff to integrate ethics content into the curriculum. The work of integrating content is a collaborative effort between the ETAs, professors, and
        rest of the course staff.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How can I get involved as an ETA?</b> <br>
        ETA hiring occurs at the same time as regular TA hiring.
        The MTAs will send out an email the semester before with information about applying for both UTA and ETA positions.
        Many of the ETAs serve both UTAs and ETAs!<br>
        <br>
        <b>How much are ETAs paid?</b> <br>
        The hourly wages for ETAs are calculated with the same formula as regular TAs. <br>
